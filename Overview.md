## Forces and Motion

1.1: 
	use the following units: kilogram (kg), metre (m), metre/second (m/s),  
	metre/second2 (m/s 2 ), newton (N), second (s) and newton/kilogram (N/kg)

1.3:
	plot and explain distance−time graphs

1.4:
	know that the relationship between average speed, distance moved and time  
	taken is speed = distance moved / time taken

*1.5:*
	*investigate the motion of everyday objects such as toy cars or tennis balls*

1.6:
	know that the relationship between acceleration, change in velocity and time  
	taken is acceleration = velocity / time taken

1.7:
	plot and explain velocity−time graphs

1.8:
	determine acceleration from the gradient of a velocity−time graph

1.9:
	determine the distance travelled from the area between a velocity−time graph and  
	the time axis

1.10:
	know that the relationship between final speed, inital speed, acceleration and distance moved is (final speed)² = (initial speed)² + ( 2 * acceleration * distance moved)

1.11:
	describe the effects of forces between bodies such as changes in speed, shape or  
	direction

1.12:
	identify different types of force such as gravitational or electrostatic

1.13:
	understand how vector quantities differ from scalar quantities

1.14:
	understand that force is a vector quantity

1.15:
	calculate the resultant force of forces that act along a line

1.16:
	know that friction is a force that opposes motion

1.17:
	know that the relationship between unbalanced force, mass and acceleration is force = mass * acceleration
